of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution and Modification

0. This license applies to any program or other work which contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
   under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
   refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
   means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
   that is, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
   verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
   (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
   "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
   the Program is not restricted, and the results obtained from it are
   not covered by this License, unless these results include works based
   on the Program.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
   code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
   and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
   and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
   this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy
   of this License along with the Program.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
   it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
   such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,
   provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   b) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
      to anyone who possesses a copy. This License will therefore apply,
      along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole
      of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are
      packaged. This does not in itself create any obligation to
      distribute any proprietary software incorporated into the
      Program.

   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
      when run, or accepts input files, or both, you must cause it, when
      given any of these commands or input files, to print or display an
      explanation stating how to view a copy of this License along with
      the Program.

3. You may also combine or link, an equivalent combination or linking
   of the Program's source with other code or data, thus forming a work
   based on the Program, and copy and distribute such combinations or
   works under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet
   all of these conditions:

   a) The combined or linked program must itself be a software
      library.

   b) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
      to anyone who possesses a copy. This License will therefore apply,
      along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole
      of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are
      packaged. This does not in itself create any obligation to
      distribute any proprietary software incorporated into the
      Program.

   d) If the combined or linked program normally reads commands
      interactively when run, or accepts input files, or both, you must
      cause it, when given any of these commands or input files, to
      print or display an explanation stating how to view a copy of this
      License along with the Program.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
   except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program is
   void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
   However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
   this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
   parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
   modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensors to run, modify and redistribute the Program subject
   to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
   this License.

7. Additional Terms. "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement
   the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of
   its conditions. For example, additional permissions may take the form
   of allowing proprietary software to be linked with the Program,
   permitting the Program to be combined with proprietary software
   packages, or permitting proprietary commands to be used with the
   Program. No additional permission or other waiver of any provision
   of this License shall be effective unless separately stated in
   writing and signed by the copyright holder.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
   you did not create yourself you may add your own copyright statement
   to the material, and license it under different terms, provided that
   you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   b) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
      to anyone who possesses a copy. This License will therefore apply,
      along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole
      of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are
      packaged. This does not in itself create any obligation to
      distribute any proprietary software incorporated into the
      Program.

   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
      when run, or accepts input files, or both, you must cause it, when
      given any of these commands or input files, to print or display an
      explanation stating how to view a copy of this License along with
      the Program.

8. NO WARRANTY

   8.1. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
        licensors provide the Program (and each contributor provides its
        Contributions) on an "AS IS" basis, without warranties or
        conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including,
        but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
        particular purpose, non-infringement, or title. You are solely
        responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
        redistributing the Program and assume any risks associated with
        your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8.2. The entire risk arising out of use or performance of the Program
        and any accompanying materials remains with you.

9. Limitation of Liability

   9.1. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event
        shall any licensor, or any contributor, be liable for any
        indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages
        whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of
        profits, business interruption, or loss of information) arising
        out of the use or inability to use the Program, even if such
        damages are foreseeable or if the licensor has been advised of
        the possibility of such damages.

   9.2. In no event shall any licensor, or any contributor, be liable
        for any damages arising from your modification of the Program,
        or from any other person's use or modification of the Program,
        or from any combination of the Program with other software or
        hardware.

10. Termination

    10.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
          automatically upon any breach by you of the terms of this
          License. Individuals or entities who have received
          derivative works or rights from you under this License, other
          than as a result of your breach, will not have their licenses
          terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in
          compliance with these terms and conditions.

    10.2. If you bring a copyright claim or any claim involving
          patent rights or other intellectual property rights against
          any contributor over the Program, your rights under this
          License shall terminate immediately.

    10.3. Sections 8, 9, and 10 shall survive termination of this
          License.

11. Miscellaneous

    11.1. This License is governed by and construed in accordance with
          the laws of the jurisdiction specified in the copyright notice
          accompanying the Program, or if no such jurisdiction is
          specified, the laws of the State of New York, without regard
          to its conflict of law provisions.

    11.2. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
          such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
          necessary to make it enforceable.

    11.3. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
          parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
          supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings and
          agreements, whether written or oral, regarding such subject
          matter.

    11.4. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
          along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
